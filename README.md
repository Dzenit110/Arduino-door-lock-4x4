# Arudino-door-lock-4x4

The project is titled Arduino-Door-Lock. It presents a typical school example of a door with a code, which we commonly use when entering a desired building or home. In this setup, after entering the correct code, a servo motor changes the mechanism in the door, simulating the movement of the door as it opens. The components include an Arduino Mega, a 4x4 keypad, LED indicators for visual signaling, and a servo motor.

## Operating Principle
When the user approaches the door and enters the correct code, the door unlocks and opens. This showcases the simulation of unlocking the door.
